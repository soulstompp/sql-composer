# Changelog

## 0.0.2

### sql-composer

- **Parameterized `:compose()` with slot arguments** — Templates can now declare named slots (`@slot_name`) inside `:compose()` that callers fill with concrete file paths. This enables composable, parameterized templates: write a shared base query once and swap in different logic (e.g. filters, data sources) at the call site. Slots are explicitly scoped — child templates do not inherit parent slots.

### cargo-sqlc

- **Recursive directory scanning** — `cargo sqlc compose` now recursively walks all subdirectories under `--source`, composing every `.sqlc` file and mirroring the directory structure in `--target`.
- **Atomic output via temp directory** — Composition writes to a temporary directory first. The target is only replaced after all files compose successfully, preventing partial output on failure.
- **Clean target** — The entire target directory is wiped and recreated on each compose run, removing stale `.sql` files from deleted or reorganized sources.
- **`--verify` mode** — Composes all templates to memory and diffs against existing target files. Reports changed, missing, and stale files, then exits with code 1 on any mismatch. Designed for CI to ensure committed `.sql` files stay in sync with `.sqlc` sources.
- **Default target changed from `sql` to `.sql`** — The hidden directory name makes it obvious that the output is generated and should not be edited directly. Override with `--target` or `SQLC_TARGET_DIR`.
